============
Installation
============

To get started, first create a virtualenv to install the project's dependencies.

I suggest using virtualenv with the virtualenvwrapper. Here is a link that will guide you to configure this correctly. `virtualenvwrapper`_

.. _virtualenvwrapper: https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Then, clone the `repo`_ inside a folder where you keep your django projects. 

.. _repo: https://github.com/ackleyd1/gameboyz

With your virtualenv activated, run in the root of the project:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the required dependencies. 

Then, configure your settings, environments variables and database to your specifications.

Finally, run the following 

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py collectstatic
    python manage.py runserver

The django project should be running at http://localhost:8000/

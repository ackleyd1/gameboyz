There are currently four major applications in the gameboyz project.

-----------
Accessories

Repo: `Accessories`_

.. _Accessories: https://github.com/ackleyd1/gameboyz/tree/master/gameboyz/accessories

This application will handle the accessories that can be bought and sold by the users.

The Accessory model will be unique in that it does not have a Base model, and may relate to a specific BaseConsole, Console, GameTitle, or Game. It is a unique product with an asin and/or epid.

The AccessoryListing model will relate back to the Accessory model and a specific user, as a part of their Collection. It contains information such as the price the user lists it for, the condition of the accessory, images of the accessory, and whether or not it is for sale. It may be listed for sale for others user to purchase and add to their Collection.

Consoles

Repo: `Consoles`_

.. _Consoles: https://github.com/ackleyd1/gameboyz/tree/master/gameboyz/consoles

This application will handle the consoles that can be bought and sold by the users.

The BaseConsole model represents what could also be considered a Platform for video games, such as the NES, SNES, N64, etc. 

The Console model will relate back to the BaseConsole model which allows us to capture variations of the console itself, such as different hardware specifications, different colors, or special releases. It is a unique product with an asin and/or epid.

The ConsoleListing model will relate back to the Console model and a specific user, as a part of their Collection. It contains information such as the price the user lists it for, the condition of the console, images of the console, and whether or not it is for sale. It may be listed for sale for other users to purchase and add to their Collection.

Games

Repo: `Games`_

.. _Games: https://github.com/ackleyd1/gameboyz/tree/master/gameboyz/games

This application will handle the games that can be bought and sold by the users.

The GameTitle model represents a video game that has been created for a BaseConsole, and may have been ported to multiple BaseConsoles. It contains information about that video game such as the name, the summary, a franchise, collections, keywords, etc.

The Game model represents a unique game for a specific console. This allows us to capture variations of the games released such as for a different console, special releases, etc. It is a unique product with an asin and/or epid.

The GameListing model will relate back to the Game model and a specific user, as a part of their Collection. It contains information such as the price the user lists it for, the condition of the game, images of the game, and whether or not it is for sale. It may be listed for sale for other users to purchase and add to their Collection.

Sales
-----

Repo: `Sales`_

.. _Sales: https://github.com/ackleyd1/gameboyz/tree/master/gameboyz/sales

This application will handle tracking the sales of the Accessory, Console, and Game models.

The Sale model represents a individual sale from one user to another. It relates back to a specific Accessory, Console, or Game. It will also contain the condition of the item, the price it sold for, and other information if supplied. They can be either from eBay, Amazon, or Gameboyz. (Note that any Amazon sales tracked cannot be verified as sold but rather assumed)

When a user sells a game on this site, a signal will be sent to create a sale from the respective Listing model.
